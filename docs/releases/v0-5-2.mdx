<Intro/>

The following are fixes and new features for [v0.5.2].

## Fixes

- The API paths for API documentation should not begin with `/api/squirrels/v0`. The following are the new paths where this prefix has been removed:
  - Swagger UI: `/project/[project_name]/[version]/docs`
  - ReDoc UI: `/project/[project_name]/[version]/redoc`
  - OpenAPI Specification: `/project/[project_name]/[version]/openapi.json`

## New features

- The following paths were added for the MCP server.
  - `/project/[project_name]/[version]/mcp`
  - `/mcp`

<Note>

The existing path `/api/squirrels/v0/project/[project_name]/[version]/mcp` is kept for backwards compatibility.

</Note>

- A new CLI command `sqrl init` was added as an alias for `sqrl new --curr-dir`.
