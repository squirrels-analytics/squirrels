<Intro/>

The following are fixes and new features for [v0.5.3].

## Fixes

- The `x-api-key` header was not being respected for MCP requests. This has been fixed.

## New features

**MCP resource for data catalog**

- A new MCP resource was added for the data catalog, which returns the same thing as the `get_data_catalog` tool
- Supporting MCP clients can use this resource to automatically add the data catalog to the system prompt when starting a new conversation, without needing the AI agent to call the `get_data_catalog` tool
- The resource has the following properties:
  - uri: `sqrl://data-catalog`
  - name: `data_catalog_from_[project_name]`
  - title: `Data Catalog (Project: [project_label])`
  - description: `Details of all datasets and parameters you can access in the Squirrels project '[project_name]'`

**API headers documentation**

- The API documentation was updated to include the `x-api-key` header.
- The configurable headers were intentionally left out of the documentation given that they are meant for internal use only.

**New welcome banner in terminal for API server**

- The welcome banner in the terminal after running `sqrl run` now looks something like this:
