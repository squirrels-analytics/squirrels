<Intro/>

The following are fixes and new features for [v0.5.4].

## Fixes

- The logic for identifying queries from the `table_or_query` argument for DataSource constructors was incorrect. It would only expect a space after "SELECT" instead of any whitespace character. This has been fixed.

## New features

None.

## More info

For more details, see the [GitHub release notes for v0.5.4][v0.5.4].
