Abstract base class for all dashboard classes.

In Squirrels projects, `Dashboard` is typically used as a common type for concrete dashboard classes that are created from your dashboard definitions; you should not instantiate `Dashboard` directly. Use one of the concrete implementations:
- [PngDashboard](/references/python/dashboards/pngdashboard)
- [HtmlDashboard](/references/python/dashboards/htmldashboard)

When defining and working with dashboards, use the concrete classes from the `dashboards` module rather than `Dashboard` itself.

If `Dashboard` is needed for type annotation, it can be imported from the `squirrels.types` or `squirrels` module.
