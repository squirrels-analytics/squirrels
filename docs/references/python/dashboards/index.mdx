The `squirrels.dashboards` module provides classes for creating and returning dashboards from Python dashboard files.

Squirrels supports two types of dashboards: PNG-based dashboards (typically generated from matplotlib or other plotting libraries) and HTML dashboards (for interactive visualizations).

## Classes

- [PngDashboard](/references/python/dashboards/pngdashboard) - Class for creating PNG format dashboards from matplotlib figures or bytes
- [HtmlDashboard](/references/python/dashboards/htmldashboard) - Class for creating HTML format dashboards from HTML strings
