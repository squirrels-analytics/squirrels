| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--ui` | Launch the local DuckDB UI |

## Examples

Open DuckDB CLI:
```bash
sqrl duckdb
```

Open the local DuckDB UI:
```bash
sqrl duckdb --ui
```

## Notes

- Exit the DuckDB CLI with `.exit`
- If a `duckdb_init.sql` file exists, it will be written to `target/duckdb_init.sql` (with additional DuckDB commands) and loaded.
- The DuckDB CLI must be installed for this command to work. If the DuckDB CLI is not installed, install it from `https://duckdb.org/install`
