description: "Learn how to connect MCP-supported AI tools (such as Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or Cursor) to your Squirrels project"
---

Every Squirrels project has an MCP server running at `/mcp` automatically. Thus, AI tools that support the Model Context Protocol can be used to ask questions about the datasets configured in a Squirrels project.

To make it easy for anyone to follow along, we will use the following MCP server URL for a [mortgage analytics Squirrels project](https://mortgage-squirrels-example.duckdns.org/) that is publicly accessible.

```text
https://mortgage-squirrels-example.duckdns.org/mcp
```

You can replace this URL with the MCP server URL for your own Squirrels project when working with this guide (such as `http://localhost:4465/mcp`).

## MCP clients

Choose which AI tool you want to use to interact with your Squirrels project.

  <Tab title="Claude Desktop">

    **Prerequisites:**

    - [Claude Desktop](https://claude.com/download) installed
    - Node.js (>= v18.0.0) and npm: Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
    - A [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai) account (the free plan works!)

    **Steps:**

    1. Open **Claude Desktop**.
    2. Click your name in the lower left corner, then click **Settings**.
    3. Click **Developer** under "Desktop app".

    4. Click the **Edit Config** button. This opens the file location of `claude_desktop_config.json`.
    5. Open `claude_desktop_config.json` in a text editor, and paste in the following:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "mortgage-analytics": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "-y", "mcp-remote", 
            "https://mortgage-squirrels-example.duckdns.org/mcp"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    6. **Save** the file and **exit Claude Desktop** (this is different than closing the window).
      - To exit Claude Desktop on Windows, click the menu icon on the top left corner and then click File -> Exit

    7. Open **Claude Desktop** again. You should now see the Squirrels project enabled by clicking the "search and tools" icon below the chat input.

    8. Ask questions about the datasets in the Squirrels project. See the section below for example prompts.

  <Tab title="Claude Code">

    **Prerequisites:**

    - [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) (CLI) installed
    - Either:
      - A [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/) account with Pro plan or higher, or 
      - A [Claude Console](https://console.anthropic.com/) account with a credit balance

    **Steps:**

    1. Add the MCP server to Claude Code with name "mortgage-analytics" and URL `https://mortgage-squirrels-example.duckdns.org/mcp`.

    ```bash
    claude mcp add --transport http mortgage-analytics https://mortgage-squirrels-example.duckdns.org/mcp
    ```

    2. Use the following commands to confirm details about the MCP server.

    ```bash
    # List all configured servers
    claude mcp list

    # Get details about the MCP server you just added
    claude mcp get mortgage-analytics
    ```

    3. Start Claude Code by running `claude` in the terminal. You can check the server status by typing `/mcp` in the chat input.

    ```bash
    # Start Claude Code
    claude

    # Check server status (within Claude Code)
    /mcp
    ```

    4. Ask questions about the datasets in the Squirrels project. See the section below for example prompts.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Cursor">

    **Prerequisites:**

    - [Cursor](https://cursor.com/download) (IDE) installed
    - A [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) account

    **Steps:**

    1. Open **Cursor**.
    2. Go to File -> Preferences -> **Cursor Settings**.
    3. Click on **Tools & MCP** in the left panel.

    ![Cursor MCP Settings](/images/cursor/settings-mcp.png)

    4. Click the **Add Custom MCP** button. This should open a `mcp.json` file.
    5. In the `mcp.json` file, paste the following and save.

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "mortgage-analytics": {
          "url": "https://mortgage-squirrels-example.duckdns.org/mcp",
          "headers": {}
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    6. Press `Ctrl+I` to open the AI agent chat interface. Use `Ctrl+T` if you need to start a new chat.
    7. Ask questions about the datasets in the Squirrels project. See the section below for example prompts.

## Example prompts

The following are sample prompts that can be used for any Squirrels project when interacting with an AI chat agent:

```text wrap
What datasets do you have access to?
```

```text wrap
What tools do you have access to?
```

The following are sample prompts specific to the mortgage analytics Squirrels project:

```text wrap
Suppose I have a 500K loan amount at 5% mortgage rate for 20 years remaining. What would be the monthly mortgage payment?
```

```text wrap
Suppose I have a 500K loan amount at 5% mortgage rate for 20 years remaining. Should I pay off the full 500K now, or keep the mortgage and invest it in the stock market instead? Run 1000 simulation trials to answer.
```
