## What is Squirrels?

Squirrels is a low-code API server framework for building data analytics APIs.

Want to serve well-described datasets to AI agents? Squirrels has you covered! Simply create a Squirrels project with a few data models and parameters. Most of the work is just writing SQL and YAML files. Then, through a built-in MCP server, the framework exposes the tools that AI agents can use to interact with your data dynamically. 

No need to reinvent the wheel with building agent tools, metadata serving, and context window control!

## Highlights

- 🚀 **Low-Code REST API Development**: Create data analytics APIs without extensive backend engineering, empowering data engineers to build production-ready services.
- 🤖 **AI-Ready Architecture**: Built-in MCP server for serving dataset metadata and results to AI agents.
- 🔌 **Multi-Database Support**: Connect to multiple databases or data warehouses within a single project and combine data across sources.
- 📊 **Flexible Data Modeling**: Write data models that can reference other data models using Jinja-templated SQL or Python.
- ⚙️ **Interactive Parameters**: Create dynamic datasets and dashboards that respond to user inputs and selections.
- 🔒 **Built-in Security**: Complete user management system with access controls, authentication, and dataset permissions.
- 💻 **Simple Developer Experience**: Quick setup with CLI commands `pip install squirrels` and `sqrl init`.
