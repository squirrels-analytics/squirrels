---

Squirrels is a low-code API server framework for building data analytics APIs.

## Why Squirrels?

Want to serve well-described dynamic datasets to AI agents? Squirrels has you covered! Simply create a Squirrels project by writing data models in SQL and configurations in YAML (and/or Python for both). Activate the API server with the CLI and use the built-in MCP server for AI agents to interact with your data safely and efficiently. 

No need to reinvent the wheel for building agent tools, serving dataset metadata, and creating token-efficient responses for tabular data!

## Highlights

- 🤖 **AI-Ready Architecture**: Built-in MCP server for serving dataset metadata and results to AI agents via token-efficient MCP tools.
- 🚀 **Low-Code REST API Development**: Create data analytics APIs using basic data engineering skills without extensive AI or backend engineering expertise.
- 🔌 **Connect Any Database**: Connect to any database or data warehouse that is supported by SQLAlchemy, ConnectorX, or ADBC. 
- 📊 **Flexible Data Modeling**: Write data models that can reference other data models using Jinja-templated SQL or Python.
- 🔗 **Multi-Database Joins**: Connect to multiple databases in a single project and join data across sources in a single dataset!
- ⚙️ **Interactive Parameters**: Create dynamic datasets and dashboards that respond to user inputs and selections.
- 🔒 **Built-in Security**: Complete user management system with access controls, authentication, and dataset permissions.
- 💻 **Simple Developer Experience**: Quick setup with CLI commands `pip install squirrels` and `sqrl init`.

## Example projects

Check out these example Squirrels projects to see what you can build:

- [sqrl-expenses-slim](https://github.com/squirrels-analytics/squirrels-examples/tree/main/sqrl-expenses-slim): demonstrates the minimum setup needed for a practical working Squirrels project by storing expense transactions as a seed
- [sqrl-expenses](https://github.com/squirrels-analytics/squirrels-examples/tree/main/sqrl-expenses): an instance of a Squirrels project for expenses analytics that can be created with `sqrl init`
- [sqrl-mortgage-analysis](https://github.com/squirrels-analytics/squirrels-examples/tree/main/sqrl-mortgage-analysis): a Squirrels project for mortgage analytics that uses Python data models to perform Monte Carlo simulations
- [sqrl-weather-analytics](https://github.com/squirrels-analytics/squirrels-examples/tree/main/sqrl-weather-analytics): an extension of the tutorial example that includes joining data from multiple sources and realtime inference with a linear regression model
